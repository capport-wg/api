Publication request writeup for draft-ietf-capport-api-06

Intended status: Proposed Standard
Working group: capport
Document shepherd: Martin Thomson

Technical Summary:

This document defines a simple HTTP API that allows a network to provide
information about captive portal status.

Working Group Summary:

This document was at times controversial in discussions.  Some participants felt
that the potential for an API of this form to be spoofed was a problem.  Some
participants felt that this particular design was especially hard for network
operators to deploy due to some of the inherent complexities in deployments.
Some participants felt that it would be necessary to include more detailed
information, such as what sites were accessible and what sites were not.  At
times there were communication difficulties in the working group that
exacerbated problems.  However, as a baseline set of features, both clients and
networks have demonstrated agreement that the current shape of this document is
acceptable.

Document Quality:

The document is short and concise and of high quality.  The fields that are
defined are all driven by real client requirements and implementation experience
in multiple implementations.  We have experience with deploying this on the IETF
network.

Personnel:

Martin Thomson is document shepherd.  Barry Leiba is the responsible Area Director.

Important information:

This document represents the consensus of the capport WG.  There were some
contentious issues, but there is consensus within the working group to publish.

IPR disclosures from authors have been checked.  No IPR disclosures have been
made with reference to this work.

IANA considerations were checked.  There is a new registry for this API, which
will need an expert assigned.  The document registers a media type, and mail has
been sent to media-types@ietf.org to solicit a preliminary review.

Validation is limited to nits check (which only has false positives).

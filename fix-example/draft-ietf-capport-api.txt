1.  Introduction

   This document describes a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   Application Program Interface (API) that allows hosts to interact
   with a Captive Portal system on a local network.  The API defined in
   this document has been designed to meet the requirements in the
   Captive Portal Architecture [I-D.larose-capport-architecture].
   Specifically, the API provides:

   o  The state of captivity (whether or not the host has access to the
      Internet)

   o  A URI that a host's browser can present to a user to get out of
      captivity

   o  An encrypted connection (TLS for both the API and portal URI)

2.  Workflow

   The Captive Portal Architecture defines three steps of interaction
   between hosts and a Captive Portal service:

   1.  Provisioning, in which a host discovers that a network has a
       captive portal, and learns the URI of the API server

   2.  API Server interaction, in which a host queries the state of the
       captive portal and retrieves the necessary information to get out
       of captivity

Internet-Draft             Captive Portal API              December 2017


   3.  Enforcement, in which the enforcement device in the network
       blocks disallowed traffic, and sends ICMP messages to let hosts
       know they are blocked by the captive portal

   This document is focused on the second step.  It is assumed that the
   location of the Captive Portal API server has been provisioned as
   part of the first step.  The mechanism for discovering this value not
   covered by this document.

3.  API Details

3.1.  URI of Captive Portal API

   In order to communicate with the captive portal API server, the URI
   provisioned to the host SHOULD use the form of a well-known URI
   [RFC5785] ending with the string ".well-known/captive-portal.json".
   If this suffix is not included in the URI already provisioned, a host
   SHOULD append the suffix when communicating to the server.

   The Captive Portal API MUST be accessed using HTTP over TLS on TCP
   port 443 (HTTPS) [RFC2818].

   For example, if the Captive Portal API server is hosted at
   example.org, the URI of the API would be: "https://example.org/.well-
   known/captive-portal.json".

3.2.  JSON Keys

   The Captive Portal API data structures are specified in JavaScript
   Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159].

   The following keys are defined at the top-level of the JSON structure
   returned by the API server:

   o  "permitted" (required, boolean): indicates whether or not the
      Captive Portal is open to the requesting host

   o  "hmac-key" (required, string): provides a per-host key that can be
      used to authenticate messages from the Captive Portal enforcement
      server

   o  "user-portal-url" (required, string): provides the URL of a web
      portal that can be presented a user to authenticate

   o  "expire-date" (optional, datetime): indicates the time at which
      the Captive Portal is expected to close

   o  "bytes-remaining" (optional, integer): indicates the number of
      bytes left, after which the Captive Portal is expected to close

   Note that the use of the hmac-key is not defined in this document,
   but is intended for use in the enforcement step of the Captive Portal
   Architecture.

3.3.  Example Exchange

   To request the Captive Portal JSON content, a host sends an HTTP GET
   request:

   GET /.well-known/captive-portal.json
   Host: example.org


   The server then responds with the JSON content for that client:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private
Date: Mon, 04 Dec 2013 05:07:35 GMT

{
   "permitted": false,
   "hmac-key": "7cec81acce3176b262a46363666a01881b0e3bf60d97a98b5409b71cc60a1ac0"
   "user-portal-url": "https://example.org/portal.html"
   "expire-date": "2014-01-01T23:28:56.782Z":
}

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD: Provide complete security requirements and analysis.

4.1.  Privacy Considerations

   Information passed in this protocol may include a user's personal
   information, such as a full name and credit card details.  Therefore,
   it is important that Captive Portal API Servers do not allow access
   to the Captive Portal API over unecrypted sessions.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines one ".well-known" URIs using the registration
   procedure and template from Section 5.1 of [RFC5785].
